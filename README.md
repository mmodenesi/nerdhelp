# nerdhelp

A django based web-app to help organizing your study. Only for obsessive nerds like me.

Create class notes, summarys, synopsis and recaps using rich text editor, latex support, embedding images and videos.

I developed it to organize my own class notes. So authentication mechanism is absent.
It's focused on organizing your knowledge on cards, tagging them, then using to prepare your exams.
